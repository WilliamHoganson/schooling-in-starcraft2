Implementing a predatory schooling/herding algorithm in Starcraft II using Burny SC2 packages
This project explores the adaptation of Boid’s algorithm, traditionally used for simulating flocking behaviors in birds, as a novel combat strategy in the real-time strategy game "StarCraft 2". I specifically focused on employing this algorithm to control swarms of Zerglings against Zealot units. The standard in-game approach allows Zealots to destroy large numbers of Zerglings before being killed; however, by implementing a flocking strategy, I aimed to minimize Zergling casualties and enhance their combat effectiveness. My algorithm integrates cohesion, and alignment behaviors from Boid’s model, with additional modifications to address the dynamics of "StarCraft 2". This includes a 'fear coefficient' that manipulates the swarm’s response to threats, thereby encouraging survival strategies such as herding and evasive maneuvers. The results, obtained through a series of controlled experiments within the game environment, indicate that Zerglings under the flocking algorithm not only survive longer but also inflict more damage on Zealots compared to the default strategy. This experiment not only demonstrates the potential of distributed robotics algorithms in video games but could suggest implications for their use in real-world applications where autonomous agents must navigate and survive in hostile environments.
